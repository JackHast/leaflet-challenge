# Leaflet Challenge

## Description 

The purpose of this repository is to create a webpage using HTML and CSS and a map using JS to visualise the magnitude and depth of all recorded earthquakes from the past 7 days. I have used the JS library leaflet.js to create the map along with the circles added to the map for each earthquake and the legend provided and the library d3.js to get the data from the API.

## Contents of Repository

This repository contains one html file, 'index.html' that utilises the javascript 'logic.js' and CSS file 'style.css' located in static/js and static/css respectively.

## Instructions

In order to run the webpage, the repository must be downloaded from github and unziped on your computer. As long as the folder 'leaflet-challenge' is kept unchanged, all that is required to run the code is to open the html file, called 'index.html', using any webbrowser.
